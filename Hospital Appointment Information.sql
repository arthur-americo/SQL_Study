'This SQL code retrieves information related to hospital appointments. Specifically, it returns details such as the 
hospital ID, appointment date, recording date, appointment item code, appointment item description, patient ID,
 patient name, phone number, cell number, and appointment type code. The code performs several left joins between the 
 hospitals appointment, appointment item, appointment item type, and patient tables to gather the necessary information. 
 Additionally, the code includes filters to limit the results to appointments scheduled for a specific hospital and a 
 specific date.'
